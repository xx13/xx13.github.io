                    <p>
                        The Vendor Map is brought to you by Glassnetic. The team here at Glassnetic is focused on increasing the velocity and quality of B2B collaboration by reducing the friction that prevents brands and technology vendors from ever having an initial conversation. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="about_mission_text">
                        The cost of this friction today is that, given the amount of time that decision makers and influencers are able to reasonably devote to discovery, marketers &amp; IT professionals are not able to be as aware of and knowledgeable about the potential vendor categories and companies that are relevant to them. On the other side of the coin, vendors spend an overwhelming amount of their time and resources on prospecting. So much so that vendor competition is often fought, won and lost more on the prospecting battlefield than on anything else.
