                    Here is more elegant version of the app that is based on the design decisions made earlier. If you like different decisions from different versions, just let me know, so I can combine them.

                    I focused on all major screens in catalog: categories, brands, and products.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used some nice features that will make your clients' shopping experience better.

                    Three categories are supported with images. Large catalog sections make it easy to tap the right one. Shopping cart can be accessed from any screen.

                    After selecting a category users will be proposed to choose a brand. Every brand tile contains logo. I can also include brand's title, or the amount of products, if needed.

                    Product card consists of a photo (no need to adjust images in order to use them), a title, a description (optional), a price tag. Tap a product to see its details or add it to the cart.

                    Customers will have an option to add 1 item to the cart in one tap.

                    Use the well-known mechanics to change the amount of products needed.

                    Tap outside the cart to get back to Products without adding anything to the cart.
