It's important to mention that the website is good-looking, modern, and responsive. I tried to stick to the elements and pages you have, so the changes won't have a global impact. Here are my thoughts and suggestions on how we can improve the design and UX.</p></div><div class="full_width_text divider"><h2>Things To Consider</h2><p><ul><li>The first screen may be challenging to understand what the service is about.</li><li>Some blocks copy one another. Seven blocks with 9 CTA's lead to 3 pages.</li><li>Some blocks are not informative enough and look generic (title, 1 sentance, CTA, background photo).</li><li>Red, green, blue and white colors for interactive elements.</li></ul></p></div><div class="full_width_text divider"><h2>Possible Ways of Improvements</h2><p><ul><li>Make sections more informative (like the one with the festival grid), including more informative headings.</li><li>Reduce the total length of the page by removing the duplicating blocks, but store even larger amounts of information.</li><li>Explain users on the go why and how they can use FilmFreeway on the first screen (for creatives and festivals).</li><li>Add some visual diversity to the sections, bring consistency to the style (reduce the amount of colors for interactive elements).</li></ul></p></div><div class="full_width_text"><h2>Old &amp; New Versions</h2><img src="img/compare.png"></div><div class="two_cols"><div class="two_cols_colored order"><img class="two_cols_colored_image" src="img/first_screen.png"></div><!-- 1st row --><div class="two_cols_text"><h2>First Screen Matters</h2><p>As your services is made for 2 user groups: filmmakers and film festivals, I suggest we should propose for every group a guide through the service from the very first glance.</p><p>There are two tabs to guide the user: one for a creative and the other one is for a festival holder.</p><p>I kept all the CTA's but re-grouped them. New users will be taught how to use the website, and members will be able to submit their entries or start listings on the go.</p><p class="grey">I used placeholders as icons right now. I'll design them in the next iteration.</p></div></div><!-- 2nd row --><div class="two_cols"><div class="two_cols_text"><h2>More Personal &amp; Friendly Content</h2><p>Showing real people's tweets as testimonials would be a more efficient way to tell about your service.</p><p>Unlike impersonal quotes without links and photos, tweets are more personal and frienldy, and more creadible source of information.</p></div><div class="two_cols_colored"><img class="two_cols_colored_image" src="img/footer.png"></div></div><div class="full_width_text"><h2>Some Extra Tips</h2><p><ul><li>It will be nice te reverse the timeline on the <a href="https://filmfreeway.com/pages/love">Testimonials page</a>. That way users will be able to explore the most recent comments first.</li><li>Based on the most common searches, we can add quick filters to the <a href="https://filmfreeway.com/festivals">Browse Festivals page</a>. The filters like 'this week', 'this month', or simply the most popular tags, like 'LA' or 'indie'.</li></ul></p></div><!-- credits --><div class="credits">Made by <a href="https://99designs.com/profiles/xx13/about">Vasili Savitski</a></div></body></html>
