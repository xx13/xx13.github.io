It was important to present data about funds, payments, cards and payment services in a very convenient way.</p></div></div><div class="two_cols"><div class="two_cols_colored order"><img class="two_cols_colored_image" src="img/prototypes.png"></div><div class="two_cols_text"><h2>Research &amp; Prototyping</h2><p>I made some research and prototyping to be sure that the dashboard meets user's needs.</p><p>All functions, filters are easy to reach, quite obvious. Still the screen doesn't look overwhelmed with information and remains rather spacious.

That way payments will cover more space on the screen, so it will be easier to work with them.
