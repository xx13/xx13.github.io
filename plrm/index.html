        Key Decisions
      </h2>
      <p>
        When I looked for the right approach, I kept the following things in mind:
        <ul>
          <li>Move away from a twitter-like outdated layout. We can <b>take advantage of larger screens</b> to present more content.</li>
          <li>Introduce <b>different content types.</b> Current version works with text entries only, but videos (other types might be added as well) will be introduced.</li>
          <li><b>Focus on Public Timeline</b> to make exploring things easier and involve more users into communication. Though private servers is still a part of the platform.</li>
          <li>Make personal profiles more personalized so they can act like a cool personal activity hub that people would love to share.</li>
          <li>Landing page may be more friendly and focused on an average user. But that's a totally different story :)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

          Layouts

          We can use space more efficiently.

      <!-- Typography -->
      <section>
        <h3>
          Explore
        </h3>
        <img src="./img/explore.png" class="img-fluid mb-4" alt="Explore">
        <p>
          Public timeline is the main working area by default. Still users will be able to switch the server in the top navigation bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Extra features will help to explore all conent: filter by entry type, sort by date/likes/comments, etc. So at some point the explore feed may look like youtube, advanced twitter and full screen instagram at different points of time but using the same interface.
        </p>

      <!-- Buttons  -->
      <section class="mt-5">
        <h3>
          User's Profile
        </h3>
          <img src="./img/user_profile.png" class="img-fluid mb-4" alt="User Profile">
        <p>
          User profile is based on the explore layout. An extra User section added â€” with some stats, description and actions. You might consider picking more common actions like 'Follow', 'Report' rather then 'Mute' and 'Block'.
        </p>
        <hr>
      </section>

      <!-- Inputs  -->
      <section class="mt-5">
        <h3>
          My Profile
        </h3>
        <img src="./img/my_profile.png" class="img-fluid mb-4" alt="My Profile">
        <p>
          My Profile view has a slightly different User section. Some buttons are missing, but Add New Entry block appears. Users can choose the type of their entry with 'Text' as a default value.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rules can be put in front of user's eyes where they totally make sense: when adding content by creating new entries or leaving comments.
