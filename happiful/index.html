                <h2>Get Started: Questionnaire</h2>
                <p>
                    Using 9 cards with 2 fields each is much better than using 18 fields on a single screen. That way users will be more likely to fill them.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Users can always skip the questionnaire by hitting Submit button, as the default values have been already picked. Default values are ‘normal’ for Current and ‘happy’ for Wanted Happiness.

                <h2>List of specialists</h2>
                <p>
                    Browse specialists that are closest to you. You can change settings (region, distance) or use search input to find the right one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Favorite specialists will be easy to notice when looking through search results. Tap a star to add a specialist to your favorites, tap once again to remove. It's important that 'Add to fav' button is large enough so you can interact with it easily.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Important actions (open detailed profile, add to favs) can be performed with left thumb. That's cool as the majority people are right-handers. If 'Add to favs' button was to the right, it will be hearder to reach it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tap a card to see specialist's details. Hit 'Back' arrow to go back to categories.
