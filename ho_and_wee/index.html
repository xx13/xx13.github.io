                <p>I didn't describe anything about aestetics as it's very specific for every single person. I focused on the things that have real impact on visitors of your website, things that might lead to bad user experience and lost clients as result.</p>

                    It is very important to have a quickly responding website as everyone hates working with slowly things. Users are likely to leave slowly websites as noone likes to wait. Three seconds for loading a simple page is way too much.

                <p class="solution">
                    You can remove heavy scripts and images or optimize them. There are two ways: a) to keep things visually as they are and adjust the code only; b) use another layout and effects that remind the previous version or totally differ from it.

                <p>
                    It's hard to navigate the website. When you click a hamburger button, you expect to see a menu. But besides the menu you are presented with inner pages as well. Inner pages dissappear when you hit Menu icon once again. That's confusing. Plus, there are some controls that doesn't help to get the info but overwhelm the page.
                </p>
                <p class="solution">
                    Let's set up logical transitions between pages. Menu can remain visible on a desktop version. It can be hidden on mobile devices, hamburger icon used instead.
                </p>
                <p class="solution">
                    Left and right arrows can be removed. You have no idea of what you will see after clickem them. There are several better ways to keep services linked with one another. You can show the list of all services on every page (maybe below the content or at the top of the page). This way users will definitely know what info they will get after clicking a link. Close icon makes no sense and should be removed as well.

                <p>
                    Low contrast makes it harder to read the information.
                </p>
                <p class="solution">
                    Lighter parts of the background image make it difficult to read white text. As content is the most imporant thing, we should make our best to deliver it to clients with no issues.
                </p>
                <p class="solution">
                    Making darker backgrounds (or moving background images for a smaller heading blocks, for expample) and adjusting typography styles will make the results better. Line height, margins, and letter spacing for large headings can be improved.

                <h2>Mobile Version</h2>
                <p>
                    Mobile devices are less powerful than computers. That's why it is important to have a lighter and simplier mobile version of the website.
                </p>
                <p class="solution">
                    Remove or use lighter images, turn off heavy scripts, use alternative minimal layout to make the website work faster on mobile devices.
