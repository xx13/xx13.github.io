                            The Vendor Map is a resource designed to help marketing and IT professionals to easily discover which enterprise technology vendor categories and companies exist. The interface is designed in a similar way to some of the most popular geographical mapping interfaces most of us use on a regular basis. Zooming into the map allows you to drill further into categories and sub categories and down to the company and product level. <a class="modal_link" href="#modal_top_faq">Go to top</a>

                            Glassnetic is the company behind The Vendor Map. The team here at Glassnetic is focused on increasing the velocity and quality of B2B interactions by removing the friction that often prevents brands and vendors from beginning a dialogue. We believe that magic happens when companies talk to each other but have watched in frustration as the channels for B2B communication have not kept up w/ the pace of innovation and volume of vendor companies and categories. <a class="modal_link" href="#modal_top_faq">Go to top</a>

                            Ask ‘Em is a new way to start a dialogue with a vendor without having to jump all the way into their typical sales process. Ask ‘Em was designed to allow you to get your initial specific questions answered by a set of vendors with minimal time, effort and friction. Using Ask ‘Em, you are able to remain anonymous and are able to put time limits on how long it should take you to digest vendors’ answers to your questions. After using Ask ‘Em, you should be able to make a far more informed decision about whether you think it makes sense to take a meeting or a phone call with one or more of the vendors you heard back from. <a class="modal_link" href="#modal_top_faq">Go to top</a>

                            The Vendor Map is free to use by anyone. Verified companies are also able to use Ask ‘Em for free to ask questions of vendors that are on the map. There is a small fee for vendors to respond to verified prospects’ questions via Ask ‘Em. <a class="modal_link" href="#modal_top_faq">Go to top</a>

                            Two of the most common reasons marketing and IT professionals give us for why they don’t want to reach out to a vendor that might be relevant to them are: 1. the fear of the onslaught of follow up that often comes w/ a vendor’s sales process and 2. they don’t want their existing vendor to find out they are shopping around. To remove this friction that prevents these valuable conversations from ever occurring, we allow verified brands to ask questions with an anonymous description (e.g. ‘Tier 1 Automotive OEM’) which gives the vendor enough information about their industry/sector but does not give out their specific contact information. <a class="modal_link" href="#modal_top_faq">Go to top</a>

                            It can take up to a couple of weeks for a vendor to get back to you.  First, they take a look at your guidance and questions and make sure they are a relevant fit. If they believe they are, they will get the right set of folks on their team to get you answers to your questions.  Please be patient as this process can take time. <a class="modal_link" href="#modal_top_faq">Go to top</a>
