                    Ask ‘Em is a new way to start a dialogue with a vendor without having to jump all the way into their typical sales process. Ask ‘Em was designed to allow you to get your initial
                    specific questions answered by a set of vendors with minimal time, effort and friction.

                    Using Ask ‘Em, you are able to remain anonymous and are able to put time limits on how long it should take you to digest vendors’ answers to your questions. After using Ask ‘Em, you should be able to make a far more informed decision about whether you think it makes sense to take a meeting or a phone call with one or more of the vendors you heard back from.

While we’re busy adding that company, you can still continue with your Ask ‘Em to the other companies in your list.

Your name, title, email or any other contact information will never be shared with the vendor unless you explicitly choose to do so.

                        • How familiar are you with the category? Newbie? Expert? Somewhere in 		between?<br>
                        • Where are you in your process/search? Are you likely to make a 		purchasing decision in the next 3 months? 6 months? 12 - 18 months? Or just at the earliest stages of kicking the tires?

                        This is where you are able to add your specific questions that you’d like to invite the vendors that you have selected to answer. While people have used Ask ‘Em for everything from the most preliminary RFIs to very detailed RFPs, a good rule of thumb is to focus on which questions you need answered to understand if the category is relevant and interesting to you and if it makes sense for you to take a meeting or phone call w/ the company that is answering the questions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="modal_text_light">
                        The time limits state the most amount of time you are willing to spend reading a vendor’s answer to that particular question. Ask ‘Em will translate your time limits into character limits for the vendors.

                        Congrats! Your work here is done. Now its time for these vendors to take a look at your guidance and questions and make sure they are a relevant fit. If they believe they are, they will get the right set of folks on their team to get you answers to your questions. Please be patient as this process can take anywhere from a few days to a week or two.
