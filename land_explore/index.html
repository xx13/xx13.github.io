        Problem
      </h2>
      <p>
        Current ‘Explore Tours’ doesn’t explain the full variety of tours available for users.

        Solution
      </h2>
      <p>
        Introduce categories on the first Explore Tours screen instead of/along with Tour cards.

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make it easy to navigate through Tours both for new and experienced users.</li>
          <li>Make it easy to browse through Tours or to find specific Tours using search and filters.</li>
          <li>No drastic changes to the layouts to prevent spending too much time on implementation.</li>

        Takeaways
      </h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is very important to have search accessible on the first Explore Tours screen. As an experienced user, I want to have a way to get directly to the tours I’m looking for, so that I don’t waste any time exploring multiple tours that I
            don’t want.</li>
          <li>It’s important to have ‘Show favs only’ feature accessible on the first Explore Tours screen. As an experienced user, I want to have access to the tours that I liked, so that I can proceed with buying/exploring content on the go.</li>
          <li>It’s important to find a fascinating representation for categories. As a new user who has no clue what type of tour I need, I want to have some obvious & interesting starting points.</li>
        </ul>

        Notes &amp; Comments
      </h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Current layout allows to address the main group of new users</b> but it won’t distract experienced users as well.</li>
          <li><b>We should consider swapping to the layout with a minified header as the default one.</b> This improvement will help focus on the essentials and show more tours. The trade-off is the reduced size of the profile background image. It
            seems to be a pretty good change to make.</li>
          <li>The height of image block in the card reduced by 20% (from 152 to 120). It allows to show the 3rd card on the screen. <b>I think we can test images and probably reduce the height to ~100.</b></li>
          <li>Users will see Explore Tours with categories only after launching the app. <b>You can get back to the screen in the following cases:</b> 1) You check ‘Favs only’ option and then uncheck it; 2) You started to type in the search field
            and then discarded the progress; 3) You can use ‘Get back’ native control (special button or gesture on the phone) after exploring different tours; 4) Log out or end the app running and then open it again.</li>
          <li>As we introduced categories in a very vivid way, <b>we may move category’s select into ‘Filters group’ and hide it with other options:</b> like sorting options, sub-categories, free/paid tours, location settings, etc. That will make
            the screen even more content focused as almost the entire width will be devoted to a search input.</li>
        </ul>
